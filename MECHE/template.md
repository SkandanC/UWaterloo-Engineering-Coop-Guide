As far as I know, there are a few paths you can take in nano coops:

- Research
- Industry
- Software development
- Law
- Quality Assurance

All of my coops were in research, mostly in academia. So, I will focus mostly on these two paths.

## Research

`If you want to be a nano researcher, ditch WaterlooWorks and go external (unless you are a junior).`

If you chose this program, you would have done some research into the coop scenario of the program. If you did, you would know that there are a limited number of nano research coops on WaterlooWorks. There are also multiple nano cohorts applying to the same coops (not to mention the science faculty students). This results in very few research coops, and the its also always the same kind every term. To separate yourself from the crowd, you need to look at places noone usually looks at.

Nearly every university in North America does some version of nanotechnology research. From personal experience, a lot of them are already familiar with Waterloo's coop program. All it took from my side to get a coop externally, in other unis, is reach out to the professors and ask them if they have any openings. I got 3 coops this way, and I am sure you can do the same.

Here are some general tips for reaching out to profs:

1. Figure out what field in nano interests you the most.
   - Is it 2D materials, photonics, nanoelectronics, etc.?
2. Search for profs doing research in that field. A simple google search will do the trick.
   - Reach out to them, attach your resume, do not attach your transcript unless your grades are stellar.
   - A large portion of the profs will not respond to you. This is normal. Do not take it personally.
3. If you end up with an interview with a prof:
   - Congrats! You are one step closer to getting a coop.
   - Don't worry too much about the interview. It is not a job interview. It is more of a casual conversation.
4. Post - interview:
   - If you get the coop, congrats! You are now a nano researcher.
   - If you don't get the coop, don't worry. There are plenty of other places to look at. Keep trying.

## Industry

The two most straightforward paths to an industry nano coop are through WaterlooWorks, and through networking/connections. The first option is easier in your first few coops, since getting a coop through WaterlooWorks is generally easier than applying through the company's website. The second option is easier in your later coops, since you would have built a network of connections by then.

## Concluding Thoughts

Nano coops are generally more hard to find, and pay less, than SE or ECE coops. But, at least for me, they sound a lot more rewarding than a regular office job, or a software development coop. I am sure you would feelt he same if this field really interests you.
