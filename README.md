# Dummy's Guide to Finding Engineering Coops at UWaterloo

Years of knowledge clubbed together in one repo to help you survive coop at UWaterloo.

I had some free time on a weekend during a coop term and decided to make this.

If somehow, you came to this repo without
visiting my [profile](https://github.com/SkandanC/SkandanC),
Hi! I am Skandan Chandrasekar, a Nano Engineering student at UWaterloo.
I have been through everything eng students at UWaterloo normally go through,
and I wish someone told me what to do to prepare
for what UWaterloo coop had to throw at me.

This repo has folders for each program, with guides in each for:

- Finding coops
- Interview tips
- Perhaps more in the future

I have tried to make this as comprehensive as possible,
but I am sure I have missed out on a lot of things.
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to open
an issue or a pull request.

## Contributing

My knowledge is limited to nano eng, and so you will
find an extensive guide for that in the nano eng folder.
If you are from another program, and would like to contribute,
please feel free to open a pull request.
I will be happy to merge it.

Find the relevant folder for your program,
and add a markdown file with your name as the file name.
The file should contain the following:

- Your coop timeline
- Anything else you want to talk about related to your program's coop positions
